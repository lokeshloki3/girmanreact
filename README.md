**Requirements:**
- A search box that retrieves data from a Mock API.
- A loader should be displayed while data is being fetched.
- Display information for all matching names.
- A popup using Shadcn Dialog that appears under the Navbar.
- The option to search directly from the Navbar in the "Show Info" section.
- If no users are found, display an image/logo with the message "No user found."

**Improvements:**
- Data can be fetched from the Backend API instead of the Mock API.
- The UI can be easily optimized for mobile view with minimal adjustments.
- Searching for a person can be done directly in the input field by making an API call to the backend.
